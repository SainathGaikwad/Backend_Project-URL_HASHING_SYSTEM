Project Details :

This project is designed to implement a URL hashing system that preserves the integrity of URLs, enables click tracking, and maintains privacy-aware hashed URLs. The main goal is to reduce long URLs, track the number of clicks, and limit or control access based on specific criteria like expiry dates and click limits, with a catch as mapping the provided url with a unique hashed string to keep it secure and also ensures the data associated with the url to remain as it is.

Technologies Used in this project are :

Node.js and Express: Backend framework for handling server-side logic and routing.
MongoDB: Database used to store URL information, hashes, click counts, and expiration details.
Postman: Used for testing APIs, validation, and functionality checks.

Postman for testing :

Tests each endpoint's functionality, validates inputs, and simulates various scenarios.
Reasoning: Ensures all functionalities like URL shortening, redirection, and validations are working as expected.
Allows for easy reproduction of test cases and verification of edge conditions.
