Assumptions for the URL Hashing System Project

1. URL Integrity and Tracking
   Assumption: The original URL will always include valid query parameters and UTM tracking codes, and they need to be preserved accurately in the shortened URL.
   Reasoning: Ensures that marketing tracking data is not lost during the URL shortening process.

2. Hash Generation
   Assumption: The generated hash is unique enough to avoid collisions, even though no explicit check for existing hashes is performed during hash generation.
   Reasoning: The random bytes generated (using 6 bytes) are considered sufficient to minimize the probability of collision in most use cases.

3. Database Operations
   Assumption: The MongoDB database connection is stable and capable of handling multiple read and write operations efficiently.
   Reasoning: MongoDB is suitable for scenarios with flexible schemas and high performance, which matches the requirements of a URL shortening service.

4. Max Clicks Validation
   Assumption: If maxClicks is not provided, it defaults to null, allowing unlimited access unless explicitly set.
   Reasoning: This approach provides flexibility, enabling both restricted and unrestricted URL access without additional configuration.

5. Expiration Date Handling
   Assumption: The expiration date, when set, is always provided in a valid ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).
   Reasoning: Ensures consistency in date handling and comparison operations within the system.

6. Error Handling for URL Access
   Assumption: Proper error messages are returned when accessing an expired URL, a URL that has reached its click limit, or a non-existent URL.
   Reasoning: This improves user experience by providing clear feedback on why the redirection failed.

7. Privacy and Security
   Assumption: No sensitive data is stored alongside the URLs, and the hashing mechanism does not expose any private information about the original URL.
   Reasoning: Ensures that the URL shortening service complies with privacy considerations, particularly when handling user-provided data.

8. Deployment Environment
   Assumption: The deployment environment will have environment variables set up correctly (e.g., DB_URL for MongoDB connection).
   Reasoning: Ensures the application runs smoothly without needing hard-coded values, maintaining security and flexibility.

9. Performance and Scaling
   Assumption: The system is primarily designed for moderate usage and may need optimization (such as caching) for high-volume environments.
   Reasoning: The current setup handles average loads well but is not yet optimized for extreme scalability.

10. Client-Side Redirection
    Assumption: The client (browser or application) will handle HTTP redirects correctly and follow the 302 status code when issued.
    Reasoning: Relies on standard HTTP behavior for URL redirection without the need for additional handling on the server side.

11. Absence of Frontend
    Assumption: The project is designed as a backend-only service, with no frontend for URL submission or management.
    Reasoning: The system is meant to function as an API, making it easy to integrate with other services or frontend applications later.

12. Testing and Validation
    Assumption: Validation checks (like maxClicks and expiresAt) are assumed to cover most common input errors, but extreme edge cases may require additional handling.
    Reasoning: Balances thorough input validation with performance, covering typical use cases without overcomplicating the validation logic.
